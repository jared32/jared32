This Shiny app helps users determine the best possible trains in Mexican Train Dominoes.

Users select the Leading Pip number that their train must begin with and then select their dominoes.

The app will automatically begin calculating the optimal trains to play based on Points Used, Dominoes Used, Turns Played, Points Remaining and Dominoes Remaining.

Enjoy!
